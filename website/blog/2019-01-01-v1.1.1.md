## Work around 2.12 regression for hanging object constructors

Scala 2.12 introduced a regression that caused asynchronous code to hang
forever in object constructors, see
[scala-dev/#195](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/195#issuecomment-450723181).
This caused mdoc issues like
[#124](https://github.com/scalameta/mdoc/issues/124), where futures would
timeout.  To workaround this problem, mdoc now uses `-Ydelambdafy:inline` by
default.

## New --no-link-hygiene option

Use the command-line argument `--no-link-hygiene` to disable link hygiene so that warnings are not reported. With sbt-mdoc, add

```scala
mdocExtraArguments := List("--no-link-hygiene")
```

## Markdown footnotes now work

Previously, markdown footnotes would render incorrectly, which has now been fixed so it's possible to write like below.

```md
Paragraph with a footnote reference[^1]

[^1]: Footnote text added at the bottom of the document
```
